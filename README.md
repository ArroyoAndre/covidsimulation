Covid Epidemics Simulation with Simpy

# Instructions
1. Clone this repo
1. Run `setup.sh`  (It might require making it executable: `chmod 777 setup.sh`)
1. Check `Example.ipynb` to understand how it works
1. Setup your own regions and modify simulation parameters and constants

# ToDo's
1. Finish cleaning up the code and translating it into English
1. Improve model of interaction between people:
  - Specifying different types of interaction between people
  - Creating sub-population and groups within interactions can occur (e.g. school class)
